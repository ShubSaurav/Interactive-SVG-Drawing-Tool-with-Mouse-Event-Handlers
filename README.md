# Interactive SVG Drawing Tool with Mouse Event Handlers

## Objective
Design and build a web-based drawing tool using SVG where users can draw shapes interactively using their mouse. This project demonstrates JavaScript DOM manipulation, SVG element creation, and advanced event handling.

## Features
- SVG area acts as a drawing canvas  
- Users can draw by clicking and dragging inside the canvas  
- Shapes are dynamically drawn following mouse movement  
- Supports multiple shapes without reloading the page  
- Implements `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` events  

## Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- SVG  


## Expected Output
The drawing tool should appear as shown below:

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository  
2. Open `practise-3.html` in any modern web browser  
3. Click and drag within the SVG area to draw shapes interactively  

## Learning Outcomes
- Creating and manipulating SVG elements dynamically  
- Handling mouse events (`mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`)  
- Building interactive web applications without page reloads
